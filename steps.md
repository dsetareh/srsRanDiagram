**Single Fuzz Test Procedure**
    1. Boofuzz generates sequences of bytes for fields given, dumping them in stdout
    2. A Python script scrapes boofuzz's output for the desired bytes and saves each sequence line by line to file (`FuzzTests`)
    3. srsEPC and srseNB are started, piping their stdout to file 
    4. Our modified srsUE is started with flag `-f#`, where `#` is the test number that is read from file (`FuzzTests`) 
    5. The modified UE replaces the contents of the fields in RRCConnectionRequest with the values that have been read from file, then resumes normal execution 

**Unmodified UE**
```cpp
    srsran::to_asn1(&rrc_conn_req->ue_id.s_tmsi(), ue_identity); // default ue_identity set
    rrc_conn_req->establishment_cause = (establishment_cause_opts::options)cause; // establishment cause set
    send_ul_ccch_msg(ul_ccch_msg); // message queued
```
**Modified UE**
```cpp
    ue_identity.mmec = (uint8_t)fuzzedMMEC; // set mmec to the byte loaded from file
    ue_identity.m_tmsi = (uint32_t)fuzzedTMSI; // set tmsi to the bytes loaded from file
    rrc_conn_req->establishment_cause = (establishment_cause_opts::options) fuzzedCause; // set cause to the bits loaded from file
    srsran::to_asn1(&rrc_conn_req->ue_id.s_tmsi(), ue_identity); // modified ue_identity set
    send_ul_ccch_msg(ul_ccch_msg); // message queued
```

    6. Take down the srsRAN stack, eNB saves MAC-layer network transmissions to a pcap file on exit 
    7. pcaps generated by srseNB are fed through a Python Script utilizing tshark to generate plaintext json data 
    8. Analytics of generated pcaps are performed to determine the success rate of the fuzzing
