# step by step walkthrough of a single fuzz test

1. Boofuzz generates sequences of bytes for fields given, dumping them in stdout
2. A Python script scrapes boofuzz's output for the desired bytes and saves each sequence line by line to file (FuzzTests)
3. srsEPC and srseNB are started, piping their stdout to file
4. Our modified srsUE is started with flag `-f#`, where `#` is the test number that is read from file (FuzzTests)
5. The modified UE replaces the contents of the fields in RRCConnectionRequest with the values that have been read from file, before the message has been sent
6. RRCConnectionRequest is received by eNB
7. Take down the srsRAN stack, eNB saves MAC-layer network transmissions to a pcap file on exit
8. pcaps generated by srseNB are fed through a Python Script utilizing tshark to generate plaintext json data
9. Analytics can be performed upon the data
